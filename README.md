# innertune replica

This project aims to replicate the visual appearance of [Malopied's Innertune fork](https://github.com/Malopieds/InnerTune) (as of 19/10/2024) in flutter, in the context of the flutter module's individual homework.

## Requirements

* Flutter+Android SDK
* Android emulator or device (real device is recommended)
* Stable internet connection on both the computer running the code and on the Android device used for testing

## How to run

* Clone this repository/unzip this repository
* Run ```flutter pub get``` to install dependencies
* (if using real device) connect device to computer and ensure that usb debugging is active
* (if using emulator) ensure the emulator has internet access
* Run ```flutter run``` to run the code

## Notes

* While the original's app is open source and also uses Material 3 (although it uses Kotlin rather than Flutter), I hereby swear that, during the development of this app, I did not look at the original source code and relied only on side-by-side visual comparison and online color pickers.
